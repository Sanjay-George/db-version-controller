# üíΩ DB Version Controller
Idea and design for an application to version control databases like MySQL, MongoDB, etc. Basically a git-like add-on to version-control your DB 

## üí° Motivation and Background study 
* Why version control your database: https://blog.codinghorror.com/get-your-database-under-version-control/
* DB version control and existing tools: https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2021-09-17-database-version-control/

### Data Structures
* Prolly trees (Dolt blog): https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2020-04-01-how-dolt-stores-table-data/
* Merkle trees

## üìù Requirements

### Share data across machines of developers
There should be a provision for developers to share data from tables or databases to others. This easily sets up development data on a new devs' machine.

### Merge data across machines
There should be a provision to merge data from one machine to another, just like with Git. This involves having to **resolve conflicts** (ID conflicts) and sometimes **cherry-picking** which data to merge and what to ignore.

This could ease the process of updating staging or testing environment with new valid test cases from local. Commonly followed approach for this is to maintain a list of queries and automatically run the queries on staging env. Or the QA team manually adds data on staging. Too much work!

### Version Control data in DB
There should be provision to commit each version of data, again like Git. This helps to **revert** to a previous version of the database incase of issues.

Local devs should be able to create their own **branches** of data and create PR against the master data for valid new test cases.

### Not a new DB, just an add-on
The tool should just be an add-on to latch onto your existing database, and not an entirely new database altogether. Just like [Git](https://git-scm.com/) works with any programming language or platform, this version-controller tool should work with any DB (SQL or NoSQL).


## ü§î Use Cases

### Scenario 1: Sharing data on dev environment
Consider Bobby üßî and A lice üêõ are devs working on the next big thing. They need a simple process to share good test cases among each other.

**Potential solutions and underlying problems**

* **Send queries for DDL and DML to each other.**
1. Overhead in creating those queries.
2. IDs may vary between them, especially if auto-incremented IDs are used. In case of doc DBs like MongoDB, the ObjectIDs / UUIDs will differ. There are cases where having same IDs is necessary for coordination (enumerations, for example).

* **Use a common DB server (cloud or local network)**
1. Overhead in setting up server.
2. They could end up polluting each other's data

Neither of the solutions provide a way to revert to an earlier version of the DB (unless you take manual backups or log schema changes, which are hectic for small teams).  

### Scenario 2: Syncing data across environments (dev, staging, prod)
TBD..

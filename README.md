# üíΩ DB Version Controller
Idea and design for an application to version control databases like MySQL, MongoDB, etc. Basically a git-like add-on to version-control your DB 

## üí° Motivation and Background study 
* Why version control your database: https://blog.codinghorror.com/get-your-database-under-version-control/
* DB version control and existing tools: https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2021-09-17-database-version-control/

## üìù Requirements

### Share data across machines of developers
There should be a provision for developers to share data from tables or databases to others. This easily sets up development data on a new devs' machine.

### Merge data across machines and environments
There should be a provision to merge data from one machine to another, just like with Git. This involves having to **resolve conflicts** (ID conflicts) and sometimes **cherry-picking** which data to merge and what to ignore.

This could ease the process of updating staging or testing environment with new valid test cases from local. Commonly followed approach for this is to maintain a list of queries and automatically run the queries on staging env. Or the QA team manually adds data on staging. Too much work!

### Version Control data in DB
There should be provision to commit each version of data, again like Git. This helps to **revert** to a previous version of the database incase of issues.

Local devs should be able to create their own **branches** of data and create PR against the master data for valid new test cases.

### Not a new DB, just an add-on
The tool should just be an add-on to latch onto your existing database, and not an entirely new database altogether. Just like [Git](https://git-scm.com/) works with any programming language or platform, this version-controller tool should work with any DB (SQL or NoSQL).


## üé® High level Design

### Components
1. **App:** This will be responsible for converting encrypted / encoded database files to text files containing DDL / DML statements and vice-versa. Human readable text files will be essential for version control. The app will also serve as a UI to resolve merge conflicts (similar to kdiff).
2. **DB Server:** MongoDB / MySQL / any other DB.
3. **DB data folder:** The path on disk where the DB stores its files and data. This depends on the database and OS used. 
4. **Sync files:** Folder containing human readable `.sql` or other type of files. This will be created by the application and is the folder that needs to be version controlled with Git.  

### Basic flow
Consider Bobby üßî and Alessandra-Maria-Chekhova üëß are developers trying to share their local data with each other. They use MySQL.

* Bobby creates a few tables, defining the schema, and adds basic data. He runs the `App` by pointing to the `DB data folder`, let's assume `/var/lib/mysql`.
* The `App` creates human-readable `.sql` files. One folder per database, and one file per table. 
* The folder created by the `App` is version controlled by Bobby (using `git init` command) and pushed to a **private** repo.
* The folder is pulled by Alessandra-Maria-Chekhova from the repo and is run through the `App`. 
* The `App` generates the `.ibd` and `.frm` files required for MySQL, which Alessandra-Maria-Chekhova copies to `var/lib/mysql`
* Alessandra-Maria-Chekhova now has the exact same copy of Bobby's database.

### Merge conflicts
Assume Bobby changed some data and wants to merge into master. 

* Bobby pulls the latest master
* He runs the `App` and points to the folder containing `sync files`. 
* The `App` shows conflicts between the changes on his machine at `/var/lib/mysql` and the master branch.
* Bobby chooses how to resolve the conflict using the UI of the `App`.
* Once resolved, he chooses to save the changes, which will modify the text files at the `Sync folder`.
* Git will now detect changes in the files corresponding to the tables that Bobby modified, and these changes can be commited and merged to master (create a PR first, ofc).

# üíΩ DB Version Controller
Idea and design for an application to version control databases like MySQL, MongoDB, etc. Basically a git-like add-on to version-control your DB 

## üí° Motivation and Background study 
* Why version control your database: https://blog.codinghorror.com/get-your-database-under-version-control/
* DB version control and existing tools: https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2021-09-17-database-version-control/

## üìù Requirements

### Share data across machines of developers
There should be a provision for developers to share data from tables or databases to others. This easily sets up development data on a new devs' machine.

### Merge data across machines and environments
There should be a provision to merge data from one machine to another, just like with Git. This involves having to **resolve conflicts** (ID conflicts) and sometimes **cherry-picking** which data to merge and what to ignore.

This could ease the process of updating staging or testing environment with new valid test cases from local. Commonly followed approach for this is to maintain a list of queries and automatically run the queries on staging env. Or the QA team manually adds data on staging. Too much work!

### Version Control data in DB
There should be provision to commit each version of data, again like Git. This helps to **revert** to a previous version of the database incase of issues.

Local devs should be able to create their own **branches** of data and create PR against the master data for valid new test cases.

### Not a new DB, just an add-on
The tool should just be an add-on to latch onto your existing database, and not an entirely new database altogether. Just like [Git](https://git-scm.com/) works with any programming language or platform, this version-controller tool should work with any DB (SQL or NoSQL).


## üé® High level Design

### Components
1. **App:** This will be the main client application for version control (kind of like GitHub Desktop). It will be responsible for converting the encoded database files to text files containing DDL & DML statements and vice-versa. Human readable text files will be essential for version control. The app will also serve as a tool to resolve merge conflicts (similar to [kdiff3](https://kdiff3.sourceforge.net/)).
2. **DB Server:** An image of the database that is used by the develoepers (eg: MySQL, MongoDB, etc.)
3. **DB data folder:** The folder on local disk where the DB stores its data files. This depends on the database and OS used. These files are usually encoded in certain formats. 
4. **Version Control folder:** Folder containing human-readable `.sql` files (or different extensions for other DBs). This will be created by the application and is the folder that needs to be version controlled with Git. These contain all DDL and DML statements required to recreate the database on any machine or environment   

### Basic flow
Consider Bobby üßî and Alessandra-Maria-Chekhova üëß are developers trying to share their local data with each other. They use MySQL.

* Bobby üßî creates a few tables, defining the schema, and adds basic data. 
* He runs the `App` by [mounting](https://docs.docker.com/storage/bind-mounts/) `DB data folder`, and the `Version Control folder`. Let's assume `/var/lib/mysql/` is the `DB data folder` and `Version Control folder` is inside the folder of the developer's application `/path-to-your-cool-app/db/`.
* The `App` creates human-readable `.sql` files in `Version Control folder`. One folder per database, and one file per table. 
* The `Version Control folder` is version-controlled by Bobby üßî (using Git) and pushed to a **private** repo.
* The folder is pulled by Alessandra-Maria-C üëß from the repo and is mounted onto the `App`. 
* The `App` generates the `.ibd` and `.frm` files required for MySQL to the `DB data folder` on her machine, which could be at `var/lib/mysql/`. (this has to be mounted as well).
* Alessandra-why-did-i-choose-a-long-nameüëß now has the exact same copy of Bobby's üßî database.

At any point, the `App` will have mounted 2 folders, `Version Control folder` and `DB data folder`. The former will contain incoming changes and the latter will have the local changes. 

Merging changes, conflict resolution, decoding and encoding data are all handled by the `App`.

That's the idea. Do let me know if you foresee some flaws...
